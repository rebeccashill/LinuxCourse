**Introduction to Linux File System**
  cd / = go into root directory
  ls -l = shows a list of different directories

**File System Structure and its Description**
  /boot = Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
    when an operating system is booting up, the system looks for /boot
  /root = root user home directory. It is not the same as /
  /dev = system devices(e.g. disk, cdrom, speakers, flassdrive, keyboard, etc.)
  /etc = configuration files
  /bin -> /usr/bin = everyday user commands
  /sbin -> /usr/sbin = system/filesystem commands
  /opt = optional add-on applications (not part of OS apps)
  /proc = running processes (only exist in memory)
  /lib -> usr/lib = C programming library files needed by commands and apps
    -strace -e open pwd
  /tmp = directory for temporary files
  /home = directory for users
  /var = system logs
  /run = system deamons that start very early (e.g., systemd & udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
  /mnt = to mount external file system (e.g. NFS)
  /media = for cdrom mounts

**File System Navigation Commands**
  Navigating File System
    when navigating a UNIX File System, there are a few important commands: "cd", "pwd", "ls"
  "cd" = change directory, primary cmd for moving you around the filesystem
  "pwd" stands for print working directory, tells you where your current location is
  "ls" stands for list, lists all the directories/files within a current working directory
  su- = add password, will tell you the last login
