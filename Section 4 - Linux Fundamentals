**Linux Command Syntax**
Command options and arguments
  - Commands typically have the syntax:
      command option(s) arguments(s)
Options:
  Modify the way that a command works
  Usually consists of a hyphen or dash followed by a single letter
  Some commands accept multiple options which can usually be grouped together after a single hyphen

ls -lt = order files based on last modified time
rm -f = remove file
ls -a, --all = do not ignore entries starting with .
ls -A, --almost-all = do not list implied . and ..
ls -l --author = print the author of each file
ls -b, --escape = print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
ls --block-size=SIZE = scale sizes by SIZE before printing them

To see these options and more, use the command "man ls"

**Files and Directory Permissions (chmod)**
There are 3 types of permissions:
  - r = read
  - w = write
  - x = execute - running a program
Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at 3 levels
  - u - user = yourself
  - g - group = can be people in the same project
  - o - other = everyone on the system
File or directory permission can be displayed by running ls -l command
chmod = command to change permission
  - man chmod to find out more
chmod g-w filename = get rid of write permission
chmod a-r filename = gets rid of all read permissions
chmod u-w filename = remove write permissions from user
chmod u+rw filename = adds read & write permissions to user
chmod o+rw filename = adds read & write permissions to others

**File Permissions Using Numeric Mode**
Permission to a file and directory can also be assigned numerically
  - chmod ugo+r FILE    OR     - chmod 444 FILE
Owners assign permission on every file and directory
REMINDER: ls -ltr to see permissions
Assigning numbers to permission types
    0    No Permission       ---
    1    Execute             --x
    2    Write               -w-
    3    Execute+Write       -wx
    4    Read                r--
    5    Read+Execute        r-x
    6    Read+Write          rw-
    7    Read+Write+Execute  rwx
ex:chmod 764 FILE
    -rwxrw-r--
chmod 000 filename: remove permissions
chmod 604 -> -rw----r--
There are also online calculators for Linux permissions

**File Ownership Commands (chown, chgrp)**
Command to change file ownership
  -chown = changes the ownership of a file
  -chgrp = changes the group ownership of a file
Recursive ownership change option (Cascade)
  - -R

**Access Control List (ACL)**

**Help Commands**
